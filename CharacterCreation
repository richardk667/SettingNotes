Backstory requirements:

At some point in the past when you were in great need a stranger offered you a favor in exchange for doing on task at a future date. You accepted and were aided exactly as promised.

Terms of the contract:
    Participant will be given at least one months warning of the task
    The task will be dangerous and potentially deadly
    The task will not impinge on the alignment or divine affiliation(paladins, clerics, etc) of the participant.
    The task will not require you to act against any of your associates
    The task may happen immediately or years hence
    The summons for the task will be obvious but is not specified
    After the task is successfully completed you may, from time to time, be notified of unique jobs with rich rewards which you can but are not required to participate in.

The initial favor could be political, military, magic, a piece of knowledge, or almost anything else. The power can be up to anything roughly equivalent to 3 wishes or something like the temporary aid of a powerful army

Remember that your powerful characters in the world and your backstory can and hopefully should reflect that.

Campaign start:
You've received the message calling in you debt and asking you to meet in a certain tavern at a certain time. You wrap up your business and go to the meeting. The door to the inn opens.
