Most groups, individuals, governments, magical creatures and equipment have a rating. The rating can may be split for different attributes, especially for groups or governments. i.e. a country might be ranked B for economy but D for military. Ratings are evaluated and recorded by the Information Guild(for a fee).

Out of Character:
This is my solution for the in character/out of character level dilemma. Player level and CR both slot into the table below to get the in game ranking. Obviously some characters/monsters are more powerful than their CR and that may be taken into account in game.
