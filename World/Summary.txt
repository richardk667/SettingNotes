Description:

The continent is inhabited by all known races and manner of beast and also some that may be unique to this plane. Outsiders of various types can also be found and some may even call the plane home. The land is mostly covered by wilderness and inhabited by magical beast but there are also many empires and kingdoms that have forced a place for themselves.

Terrain:
    Varies by region(See map). In genral the central regions are extreamly mountinous and the outer regions are more gental. The east and west are more tropical while the north and south are temperate to chilly. Rhe center is average but due to its mountainous terrain is renowned for it cold.

Planer connections:
    Atian is highly planer and is rumored to hold at least one portal to every outer and inner plane as well as the material plane. Connections take two forms:
        Portal/Rift:
            Obviously visable 
            Short or long lived but eventually expire
            Naturally occuring
                -Appear in related locations
        Overlay:
            More subtle
            A gradule blending of one plane to anouther
            Can form if a location is strongly aligned to a plane
                - For example a commune of fire elementals might create an overlay to the elemental plane of fire.
